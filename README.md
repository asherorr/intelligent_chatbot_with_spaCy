SECTION 1: GENERAL INFO

This chatbot uses the OpenWeather API to tell users what the current weather is in any city. 

It is intelligent enough to respond to a userâ€™s statement- even when the user phrases their statement in different ways. It is also capable of telling users if they need to simplify their statement.

I used this guide to help create the script: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-an-intelligent-chatbot-in-python-using-the-spacy-nlp-library
